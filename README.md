# BlinkID SDK wrapper for PhoneGap

This repository contains example wrapper for BlinkID native SDKs ([iOS](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-android)). Not all features of native SDKs are available in PhoneGap wrapper. However, the wrapper is open source, so you can easily add features that you need. For 100% of features and maximum control, consider using native SDKs.

## Dependencies
MicroBlink.framework/MicroBlink file in iOS submodule exceeds GitHubs limited file size of 100MB.
To correctly init the submodule Git LFS is needed. Git LFS can be installed with homebrew:

```shell
brew install git-lfs
```

After installation, don't forget to restart the terminal!

## Clone or Download repository
Downloading a repository just downloads the files from the most recent commit of the default branch but without all the dependencies which are in submodules. We recommend that you clone directory. With a clone option you will get a copy of the history and itâ€™s functional git repository.

To clone repository:
+ **Copy URL from Clone or download button: https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-phonegap.git**
+ **Open terminal on Mac/Linux or [GitBash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) on Windows.**
+ **cd into directory where you want the cloned directory to be made.**
+ **Type `git clone ` , than past URL**
+ **Press enter**


## Submodules
After cloning repository, make sure you clone also its submodules:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## How to get started

### Cordova

Sample Cordova app is generated with a script

```shell
./initCordovaDemoApp.sh
```

To run iOS demo application open Xcode project BlinkIdDemo.xcodeproj

To run Android demo application type

```shell
cordova run android
```

### Ionic

Sample Ionic app is generated with a script

```shell
./initIonicDemoApp.sh
```

To run iOS demo application open Xcode project BlinkIdDemo.xcodeproj

To run Android demo application type

```shell
ionic run android
```
### Video tutorial
Step by step guide how to start BlinkID Ionic v2. A tutorial flows from git clone to successfully deployed demo application on Android and iOS device with real-time screen mirroring. Application demo contains simple use of MRTD recognizer with Croatian ID card.

### Licensing

- [Generate](https://microblink.com/login?url=/customer/generatedemolicence) a **free demo license key** to start using the SDK in your app (registration required)

- Get information about pricing and licensing of [BlinkID](https://microblink.com/blinkid)

## Installation

First generate a empty project if needed:

```shell
cordova create <path> <package> <name>
```

> The shown instructions are for **Cordova**, the instructions for **Ionic** and **PhoneGap** are practically the same, except for some slight command line argument differences.

Add the **BlinkID** plugin to your project:

```shell
cd <path_to_your_project>
cordova plugin add <blinkID_plugin_path>
```

### Android

Add Android platform support to the project:

    cordova platform add android
    
### iOS

Add iOS plaform support to the project:

    cordova platform add ios

## Sample

Here's a complete example of how to create and build a project for **Android** and **iOS** using **cordova** (you can substitute equivalent commands for **phonegap**):

```shell
# pull the plugin and sample application from Github
git clone https://github.com/BlinkID/blinkid-phonegap.git

# initialize and update submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update

# create a empty application
cordova create testcordova

cd testcordova

# add the blinkID plugin
cordova plugin add ../blinkid-phonegap/BlinkID

# add android support to the project
cordova platform add android

# build the project, the binary will appear in the bin/ folder
cordova build android

# add ios support to the project
cordova platform add ios

# build the project
cordova build ios
```

In **phonegap** CLI instead of "platform add" just request a build for the platform using "build android" or "build ios". You will have to do the manual steps described above to be able to do a successfull build.

You can also use provided `initDemoApp.sh` script that will generate a demo app that uses the plugin:

```shell
./initDemoApp.sh
```

To run the script, you'll need BASH environment on Windows (Linux and MacOS use BASH by default).


## Usage

To use the plugin you call it in your Javascript code like the demo application:

```javascript

/**
* Use these scanner types
* Available: "PDF417", "USDL", "Bar Decoder", "Zxing", "MRTD", "UKDL", "MyKad"
* PDF417 - scans PDF417 barcodes
* USDL - scans barcodes located on the back of US driver's license
* Bar Decoder - scans code39 and code128 type barcodes. Both Code 39 and Code 128 are scanned by default when using Bar Decoder.
* Zxing - scans various types of codes (i.e. QR, Aztec). Types of scanned codes can be modified in plugin classes (Explained later in this readme). By default, scanned codes are set to: Code 39, Code 128, EAN 13, EAN 8, QR, UPCA, UPCE
* MRTD - scans Machine Readable Travel Document, contained in various IDs and passports
* UKDL - scans the front of United Kingom driver's license
* MyKad - scans the front of Malaysian ID cards
* Variable << types >> declared below has to contain all the scanners needed by your application. Applying additional scanners will slow down the scanning process
*/
var types = ["PDF417", "UKDL", "MRTD"];

/**
 * Image type defines type of the image that will be returned in scan result (image is returned as Base64 encoded JPEG)
 * available:
 *  "IMAGE_NONE" : do not return image in scan result

 *  "IMAGE_CROPPED" : return cropped document image (successful scan)

 */
var imageType = "IMAGE_CROPPED"

+ Available scanners are:
    + **PDF417** - scans PDF417 barcodes
    + **USDL**  - scans barcodes located on the back of US driver's license
    + **Bar Decoder** - scans code39 and code128 type barcodes. Both Code 39 and Code 128 are scanned by default when using Bar Decoder.
    + **Zxing** - scans various types of codes (i.e. QR, Aztec). Types of scanned codes can be modified in plugin classes (Explained later in this readme). By default, scanned codes are set to: Code 39, Code 128, EAN 13, EAN 8, QR, UPCA, UPCE
    + **MRTD** - scans Machine Readable Travel Document, contained in various IDs and passports
    + **UKDL** - scans the front of United Kingom driver's license
    + **MyKad** - scans the front of Malaysian ID cards
	
+ On returned result, image can also be returned (under "resultImage" field) as base64 string of JPEG image. Type of returned image is specified as second argument and can be:
	+ "IMAGE_NONE" - No image will be returned
	+ "IMAGE_SUCCESSFUL_SCAN" - Whole input image which returned the result.
	+ "IMAGE_CROPPED" - Cropped and dewarped image of scanned object. For example, ID recognizers will return cropped and dewarped image of ID


+ All license parameters must be provided (for **iOS** and **Android**) even if you do not plan to run the application on both platforms. The licenses that you do not have/use must be set to `null`.


## Changing scanner settings

To change scanner settings you need to modify Phonegap plugin classes for iOS and Android. Plugin classes are located in ./BlinkID/src . All necessary settings documentation is located in those source files.
